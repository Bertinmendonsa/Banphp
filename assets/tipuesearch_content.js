Screening for glaucoma is done with non-contact tonometer by an optometrist initially followed by an elaborative evaluation with glaucoma specialist.We are equipped with state of the art technology like applanation\/air puff\/ iCare tonometers, Humphrey field analyzer [Carl Zeiss] and Optical coherence tomography(OCT) so that the diagnosis is never missed. Treatment Treatment for glaucoma depends on the staging of the disease and the other associated ocular findings of the patient. Medical management in the form of eye drops is suggested in the initial visit to control the intraocular pressure and thus bring the disease under control. If the medical management fails to bring the disease under control, laser treatment and surgical management is advised with all risks and benefits being explained to the patient. Surgical management includes trabeculectomy with or without the usage of antimetabolites, trabeculectomy with ologen, and glaucoma drainage devices like the Ahmed glaucoma valve, the AADI valve etc. Glaucoma experts at Bangalore Nethralaya are also well trained to deal with congenital and juvenile glaucomas with high success rate.

If youve never had an eye exam, you deserve to know what to expect when you visit the hospital.A comprehensive eye examination is much like any other complete physical examination. Your eye doctor will use various tests, tools and procedures to examine your vision as well as the health of your eye and recommend corrective lenses if your vision isnt 100%. In some cases you may need a mild prescription to help improve your vision, while in others your doctor may recommend more extreme measures.Your eye doctor will also review the overall health of your eyes including the anterior segment (lids, lashes, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, pupil and lens) as well as the posterior segment (vitreous, retina, macula, arteries\/veins and optic nerve) to check for common eye diseases. The typical eye exam can take between 30  45 minutes depending on the health of your eyes.
